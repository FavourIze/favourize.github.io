            <h4><blockquote><cite>Favour,2024</cite>"The best thing to watch in Olympics is short distance run and relay!"</blockquote></h4>
              <P>If there was one thing I would want to become in the next world,it would be an Athlete!The excitement that it brings to being able to represent
                 your country but causing many all over the world to be united in sportmanship is absolutely incredible!A number of events takes place 
                 in the Olympics Games,every 4 years.There is an sport to always look forward to.But for me that will be track and field!</p>
             <p>As Olympics has gained popularity,looking forward every four years for sportsmanship spirit</p>

           <p style="size: 200px;">But if you ask what makes me watch Olympics,I would say short distance run and relay! The different  personalities that come through whether 
            they are personal favourites or villains,is a bonus!Can't lie it has definitely forced me to want to get to know my personal favs beyond the commentating.So I have decided to make a list 
            on them,for you also get to know them.Though heads up not all  on this list our athletics, so before you come for me I know!

              <img src="favour ofilli excited.jpg" alt="favour ofilli" class="Athletes"> 
              <p>Favour started out on track from a young age,so you can almost 
               say it has been her natural talent.This has set out in her local championships 
               to international level to representing Nigeria.</section>
             
<br>
             <p>Even with her setback caused by Nigeria's administration 
              for not registering for the women's 100m.It almost felt that the 
              technical difficulties caused her years of training to go to waste.But thankfully,
              she still had the opportunity to compete in 200m and women's 4x100 relay.</p> 

              <br>
